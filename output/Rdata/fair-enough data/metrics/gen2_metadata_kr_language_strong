 title: "FAIR Metrics Gen2 - Metadata Knowledge Representation Language (strong)"
 x-tests_metric: 'https://purl.org/fair-metrics/Gen2_FM_I1B'
 description: >-
   Maturity Indicator to test if the metadata uses a formal language broadly applicable for knowledge representation.  This particular test takes a broad view of what defines a 'knowledge representation language'; in this evaluation, a knowledge representation language is interpreted as one in which terms are semantically-grounded in ontologies.  Any form of RDF will pass this test (including RDF that is automatically extracted by third-party parsers such as Apache Tika)
